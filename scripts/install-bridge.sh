#!/bin/bash
# Install the interceptor-bridge .app bundle. Registers it with
# LaunchServices via lsregister so macOS TCC + System Settings → Privacy &
# Security can address it by CFBundleIdentifier (com.interceptor.bridge), and
# wires up the LaunchAgent to keep the bridge running.
#
# Legacy-compat: also keeps a bare-binary symlink at ~/.local/bin/interceptor-bridge
# pointing into the bundle, so older callers that hard-code that path still work.
#
# Env overrides:
#   INTERCEPTOR_BRIDGE_BIN   Absolute path to use as the bridge binary in the
#                            generated LaunchAgent plist. When set, the binary
#                            is NOT copied — the path is referenced as-is.
