# Capture And Vision

## Capture (ScreenCaptureKit + CGSHWCaptureWindowList)

```bash
interceptor macos screenshot                       # Frontmost window
interceptor macos screenshot --app "Brave Browser" # Specific app — works occluded / minimized / cross-Space
interceptor macos screenshot --save                # Save to disk; result has filePath, no inline data
interceptor macos screenshot --save --target-max-long-edge 1568   # Clamp long edge for upload-friendly size
interceptor macos capture start                    # Start continuous 30 fps capture
interceptor macos capture frame                    # Get latest frame
interceptor macos capture stop
```

Default capture is **background-friendly** — `CGSHWCaptureWindowList` reads compositor buffers without raising the target. Use `--app "X"` instead of activating the app.

## Stream (continuous frames)

```bash
interceptor macos stream start --app "Finder"
interceptor macos stream frame                     # Latest JPEG data URL
interceptor macos stream fps                       # Current FPS
interceptor macos stream stop
```

## Vision (on-device, Apple's Vision framework)

```bash
interceptor macos vision text                      # OCR — read printed text in frontmost window
interceptor macos vision faces                     # Face detection (bounding boxes + landmarks)
interceptor macos vision hands                     # Hand pose (21-joint model)
interceptor macos vision bodies                    # Body pose
```

Use vision when text or pixel-region content is needed and the AX tree is opaque (rendered HTML in a WKWebView, image-only documents, video frames).

## Audio Intelligence

```bash
interceptor macos listen start                     # Real-time speech recognition
interceptor macos listen transcript                # Snapshot current transcript
interceptor macos listen tail                      # Poll-friendly streaming transcript
interceptor macos listen stop                      # Stop + return transcript

interceptor macos vad start                        # Voice activity detection
interceptor macos vad status                       # RMS level + isSpeaking

interceptor macos sounds start                     # Sound classification (300+ types)
interceptor macos sounds status

interceptor macos audio output start               # Capture system audio
interceptor macos audio input start                # Capture microphone
```

Speech, VAD, and sound classification are independent runners — start any combination, query status, stop independently.

## Permissions

- **Screen Recording** is required for `screenshot`, `capture`, `stream`, and `vision` operations on most macOS versions. Run `interceptor macos trust` to confirm.
- **Microphone** is required for `listen`, `vad`, `sounds`, `audio input`. `audio output` (system audio) does not need the microphone permission but does need Screen Recording on recent macOS.
- After granting, verify the live path: `interceptor macos audio input start` then `interceptor macos audio input stop`. A green light from `trust` does not always mean the helper has live access yet.

## Common mistakes

- Trying to use `interceptor screenshot` (browser surface) for a native window. The browser surface only sees the active Chrome tab. Use `interceptor macos screenshot --app "X"` for any native window.
- Activating the target app to screenshot it. Not needed — `CGSHWCaptureWindowList` works on occluded and minimized windows.
- Saving large screenshots without `--target-max-long-edge`. Multi-MB PNGs blow up agent context windows; use `--save --target-max-long-edge 1568` for the upload-friendly default.
