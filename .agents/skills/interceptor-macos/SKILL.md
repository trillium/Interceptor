# Interceptor macOS

Agent-operator skill for the macOS surface of Interceptor. Use the `interceptor macos *` CLI to drive native macOS applications: AX trees, OS-level trusted input, capture / vision / speech / NLP / Apple Events, monitor-and-replay, overlays. Use `interceptor macos cdp` / `interceptor macos cdp app` for Electron app web contents, and `interceptor macos runtime` for in-process native app runtime control. For content inside a browser tab load `interceptor-browser` instead.

The macOS bridge is a Swift daemon launched as a LaunchAgent / `.app` bundle. Links Apple frameworks only (Accessibility, ScreenCaptureKit, AVFoundation, Speech, Vision, NaturalLanguage, OSLogStore, NSAppleScript, container runtime). No private APIs.

This installed skill is self-contained. Source checkouts also have `AGENTS.md`, but packaged users may only have the skill directory below `/Library/Application Support/Interceptor/skills`.

> Installed extensions may add capabilities under `interceptor macos <prefix> <cmd>`. Each carries its own skill (`interceptor-ext-<name>`); this skill does not describe them. Run `interceptor extensions list` to see what is installed.

## Fast Path

```bash
interceptor status                       # 1. Confirm daemon + bridge are alive
interceptor macos trust                  # 2. Confirm TCC permissions granted
interceptor macos open "Finder"          # 3. Tree + windows (background — does NOT raise Finder)
interceptor macos read                   # 4. AX tree + frontmost info
interceptor macos act e5                 # 5. AX press of ref e5 — no focus change
interceptor macos act e3 "hello"         # 6. AX value-set of ref e3 — no focus change
```

Treat `eN` refs as short-lived. AX state can change between calls; re-read before acting.

## The One Rule

**Only two commands move focus:** `interceptor macos app activate <app>` and `interceptor macos open <app> --activate`. Everything else is background-first by contract — `open` (without `--activate`), all input verbs, all reads, capture, AX, menu, intent dispatch, scroll, drag, vision, overlays. If you call any other command and the user's frontmost app changes, that is a bug — file it.

## Workflows

Each workflow is a complete self-contained "you are doing X" procedure. Open the file when the task matches.

| Workflow | When to invoke |
|---|---|
| [`workflows/capture-backgrounded-app.md`](workflows/capture-backgrounded-app.md) | Screenshot an occluded / minimized / cross-Space window — without activating it |
| [`workflows/drive-backgrounded-app.md`](workflows/drive-backgrounded-app.md) | Click / type / keys / drag against a non-frontmost app via AX + `postToPid` |
| [`workflows/dispatch-apple-event.md`](workflows/dispatch-apple-event.md) | Apple Events to a named bundle id — open URL in Brave, read active tab, etc. |
| [`workflows/read-ax-tree.md`](workflows/read-ax-tree.md) | `tree --app` of any app, with automatic Electron wake-up |
| [`workflows/record-and-replay-mac-flow.md`](workflows/record-and-replay-mac-flow.md) | `macos monitor` record + export + replay native UI flows |
| [`workflows/trusted-input-gate.md`](workflows/trusted-input-gate.md) | Satisfy an OS-level trusted-input gate that filters synthetic CGEvents |
| [`workflows/clear-human-verification-gate.md`](workflows/clear-human-verification-gate.md) | Clear a CAPTCHA / human-verification gate (reCAPTCHA, Turnstile, hCaptcha, generic) in the user's own signed-in session via cross-origin widget coordinate mapping + trusted `--os` click |

## When To Switch Surfaces

If the target is **inside a browser page** (DOM, network, SPA state, browser monitor, scene graph of a rich editor) - load `interceptor-browser` instead.

If the target is **inside an Electron/Chromium desktop app's web contents** (Slack, VS Code, Notion, Descript, etc.) - use [`references/cdp-app.md`](references/cdp-app.md), not AX screenshots.

If the target is **inside a native app's runtime** (AppKit/SwiftUI object graph, selector calls, rendered text changes, hooks, MapKit state) - use [`references/native-agent.md`](references/native-agent.md). AX is still the fallback projection when the in-process agent is unavailable.

## Do Not Default To Troubleshooting

- User wants a macOS task completed → run Interceptor commands.
- User wants Interceptor fixed, installed, or explained → that's a separate task; ask before diving into repo state.
- Inside the Interceptor repo, use this skill for live macOS validation, not as the primary source of repo-development instructions.
